3. How to apply a click event to all paragraphs except for the last?
$(document).ready(function() {
	$("p:not(:last-child").click(function() {
		alert();
	});
});


4. Why does the alert show "Jack" first and then undefined?
function identity() {
	var name = 'Jack';
	alert(name);
	return
	name
};
JavaScript is always synchronous and single-threaded. 
So, it will render line by line as the second statement is alert it will show first and in JavaScript every statement will take semicolon. 
Thatâ€™s why in alerted undefined. Return should be in single line it will alert the "Jack".
